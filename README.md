Contribution:
Dabeer:
I did the AJAXQUERY in index html and CSS and remodularized the code so it fits the specs. I also handled errors from previous assignments

Abdullah:
Rewrote search results html, and the search and index functon in flask routes to fit the requirements. Also did the pylint.

Since there werent any major changes to the assignment, except ajaxquery, we dont have a lot to comment about each others work too!

Resources:
PSET3, LECTURES, CHATGPT, and STACKOVERFLOW were all helpful in debugging, setting up ajax, and modularizing the code.


We took about 8-10 hours

Assessment:
This assignment was helpful in learning AJAXQUERY and seeitng up dynamic results, would have been better if this was done before the mid term perhaps
